def create_Gaussian_kernel(cutoff_frequency):
  """
  Returns a 2D Gaussian kernel using the specified filter size standard
  deviation and cutoff frequency.

  The kernel should have:
  - shape (k, k) where k = cutoff_frequency * 4 + 1
  - mean = floor(k / 2)
  - standard deviation = cutoff_frequency
  - values that sum to 1

  Args:
  - cutoff_frequency: an int controlling how much low frequency to leave in
    the image.
  Returns:
  - kernel: numpy nd-array of shape (k, k)

  HINT:
  - The 2D Gaussian kernel here can be calculated as the outer product of two
    vectors with values populated from evaluating the 1D Gaussian PDF at each
    corrdinate.

  Takes two images and a low-pass filter and creates a hybrid image. Returns

  Args
  - image1: numpy nd-array of dim (m, n, c)

  HINTS:
  - You will use your my_imfilter function in this function.
  - You can get just the high frequency content of an image by removing its low
    frequency content. Think about how to do this in mathematical terms.
  - Don't forget to make sure the pixel values of the hybrid image are between
    0 and 1. This is known as 'clipping'.
  - If you want to use images with different dimensions, you should resize them
    in the notebook code.
